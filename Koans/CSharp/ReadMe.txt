The DotNet Koans walk you along the path to enlightenment in order to learn .NET. The goal is to learn 
a .NET language (C#, VB.NET, F#, etc), syntax, structure and some common functions and libraries.

The DotNet Koans came about because of the most enlightened RubyKoans (github.com/edgecase/ruby_koans) 
and follow the structure of it most closely.

To walk the path to enlightenment:
1. Open the CSharp solution or the VBNet solution.
2. Build (e.g. by pressing F7).
3. Double click the line with the warning.
4. Fix the code.
5. Go to step 2 until all koans are solved.
